    "    Notes\n",
    "    - Heart Rate Variability (HRV) represents the fluctuations between two consecutive beats in the heart rate record.\n",
    "    - Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is based on the estimation of the distance between two consecutive beats which often called NN intervals or RR intervals.  \n",
    "    - Variation in the heart rate can be evaluated using two main methods: time-domain and Frequency domain. \n",
    "    - Some of these measures are derived from direct estimation of the RR interval. Others are derived from the differences between RR intervals.\n",
    "    - Many of the measures correlate closely with others.\n",
    "    - The method selected should correspond to the aim of each study.\n",
    "    - The key part before applying any of these methods is to accurately estimate the RR intervals for a given signal. \n",
